# Intro
This is a test app which uses GrpahlQL in a node server with a apollo client in the front end react app
The data being used is from a api called [spacex](https://docs.spacexdata.com/#eda45a06-9f05-40f1-a333-028f647ba797).

I have used the following as resources for the app - [Traversy Media Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=SEMTj8w04Z8&feature=youtu.be) & [Traversy Media Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XwkFm5a9lw)

The URL for the api is [launches](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches) & [launch](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/{{flight_number}})

# Running The App
To run the app simply pull down the repo and in the main directory run the command **npm i**
You can choose to use a .env file but the nature of the app I haven not done this.

## Running app locally
To the the app locally you simply run the command **npm run server** and nodemon is used to run the app lcoally
